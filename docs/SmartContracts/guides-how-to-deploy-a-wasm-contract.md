### Deploy Your Smart Contract on Selendra

Before deploying your smart contract on the Selendra Mainnet, you are recommended deploying the contract on your local development chain, and after that on the [Indranet](https://testnet.selendra.org).

First, select Indranet on the top left of the chain selection menu.
