### Setup Environment

#### Introduction
Selendra is based on Substrate. we support ink!, an [eDSL](https://wiki.haskell.org/Embedded_domain_specific_language) to write WebAssembly based smart contracts using the Rust programming language. 

Learn more from Parity Technologies refer to this page: https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/

#### Prerequisites

#### Arch Linux
```
pacman -Syu --needed --noconfirm cmake gcc openssl-1.0 pkgconf git clang
export OPENSSL_LIB_DIR="/usr/lib/openssl-1.0"
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR="/usr/include/openssl-1.0"

```

#### Ubuntu/Debian
Use a terminal shell to execute the following commands:
```
sudo apt update
# May prompt for location information
sudo apt install -y cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git build-essential clang libclang-dev curl libz-dev

```

#### macOS
Open the Terminal application and execute the following commands:

```
# Install Homebrew if necessary https://brew.sh/
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# Make sure Homebrew is up-to-date, install openssl and cmake
brew update
brew install openssl cmake

```

#### Latest Nightly
Use a terminal shell to execute the following commands:
```
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly

```
